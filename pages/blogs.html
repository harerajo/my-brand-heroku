      And the University of Reading said it was closing its three campuses "due to the risk of Storm Eunice to our
      community".
      SCOTLAND
      Scotland is expected to be lashed by Eunice on Friday with a yellow weather warning in place for snow until 6pm.
      Forecasters have anticipated blizzards to hit large parts of the country - with up to 20cm of snowfall expected in
      some

      parts.
      Dozens of schools have already taken measures to shut their doors ahead of the severe weather.
      In Aberdeenshire more than 30 schools were closed due to the forecast heavy snow.
      And it's expected more schools will follow suit.The aim of these writing prompts is to encourage freewriting. This

      getting yourself noticed?Formatted as a private autobiographical account, Anton Chekhov’s “A Boring Story” is the
      story of an elderly and
      illustrious medical professor named Nikolai Stepanovich. As Nikolai Stepanovich declares early in his account “my
      name<br><br><br><br>
      is closely associated with the conception of a highly distinguished man of great gifts and unquestionable
      usefulness”

      (I). But as “A Boring Story” progresses, these positive first impressions are undermined, and Nikolai Stepanovich
      describes in great detail his financial worries, his obsession with death, and his bouts of sleeplessness. He even
      views
      his physical appearance in an unflattering light: “I am myself as dingy and unsightly as my name is brilliant and
      splendid” (I).


      Many of Nikolai Stepanovich’s acquaintances, colleagues, and family members are sources of great irritation. He is
      tired
      of the mediocrity and absurd formality of his fellow medical specialists. And his students are a burden. As
      Nikolai<br><br><br><br><br>
      Stepanovich describes one young doctor who visits him in search of guidance, ‘the doctor gets a subject from me
      for his
      theme not worth a halfpenny, writes under my supervision a dissertation of no use to anyone, with dignity defends
      it in
      a dreary discussion, and receives a degree of no use to him” (II). Added to this are Nikolai Stepanovich’s wife,
      an
      “old, very stout, ungainly woman, with her dull expression of petty anxiety,” (I) and Nikolai Stepanovich’s
      daughter,
      who is being courted by a foppish, suspicious fellow named Gnekker.

      How to Prevent Students from Becoming Bored
      Yet there are a few consolations for the aging professor. Two of his regular companions are a young woman named
      Katya<br><br><br><br>
      and “a tall, well-built man of fifty” named Mikhail Fyodorovich (III). Although Katya and Mikhail are full of
      disdain
      for the society, and even for the world of science and learning, Nikolai Stepanovich seems attracted to the
      uncompromising sophistication and intelligence that they represent. But as Nikolai Stepanovich well knows, Katya
      was
      once extremely troubled. She tried a theatrical career and had a child out of wedlock, and Nikolai Stepanovich
      served as
      her correspondent and counselor during these misadventures.

      As “A Boring Story” enters its final stretches, Nikolai Stepanovich’s life begins to take an increasingly
      unpleasant
      direction. He tells of his summer vacation, where he suffers from sleeplessness in “a small, very cheerful little
      room<br><br><br><br>
      with light blue hangings” (IV). He also travels to Gnekker’s hometown, Harkov, to see what he can learn about his
      daughter’s suitor. Unfortunately for Nikolai Stepanovich, Gnekker and his daughter elope while he is away on this
      dreary
      excursion. In the story’s final paragraphs, Katya arrives in Harkov in a state of distress and begs Nikolai
      Stepanovich
      for advice: “You are my father, you know, my only friend! You are clever, educated; you have lived so long; you
      have
      been a teacher! Tell me, what am I to do" (VI). But Nikolai Stepanovich has no wisdom to offer. His treasured
      Katya
      leaves him, and he sits alone in his hotel room, resigned to death.Family Troubles: Without really shifting its
      focus from Nikolai Stepanovich’s private thoughts and feelings, “A Boring
      Story” provides an informative (and largely unflattering) overview of the larger power dynamics in Nikolai
      Stepanovich’s
      household. The elderly professor looks back longingly on his early, affectionate relationships with his wife and
      daughter. By the time the story takes place, however, communication has broken down, and Nikolai Stepanovich’s
      family
      slyly opposes his likings and wishes. His affection for Katya is a particular point of contention since his wife
      and
      daughter both “hate Katya. This hatred is beyond my comprehension, and probably one would have to be a woman in
      order to
      understand it” (II).

      Instead of drawing Nikolai Stepanovich’s family together, moments of crisis only seem to force them farther apart.
      Late
      in “A Boring Story”, the aged professor awakes one night in a panic—only to find that his daughter, too, is wide
      awake
      and overburdened with misery. Rather than sympathizing with her, Nikolai Stepanovich retreats to his room and
      thinks
      over his own mortality: “I no longer thought I should die at once, but only had such a weight, such a feeling of
      oppression in my soul that I felt actually sorry that I had not died on the spot” (V).

      With Nikolai Stepanovich, Chekhov has created a protagonist who finds meaningful action virtually impossible.
      Nikolai
      Stepanovich is an intensely self-conscious character—and yet, is weirdly incapable of using his self-awareness to
      improve his life. For instance, even though he feels that he is becoming for too old for medical lecturing, he
      refuses
      to give up his lectureship: “My conscience and my intelligence tell me that the very best thing I could do now
      would be
      to deliver a farewell lecture to the boys, to say my last word to them, to bless them, and give up my post to a
      man
      younger and stronger than me. But, God, be my judge, I have not manly courage enough to act according to my
      conscience”
      (I). And just as the story seems to be nearing its climax, Nikolai Stepanovich forms a weirdly anti-climactic
      resolution: “As it would be useless to contend against my present mood and, indeed, beyond my power, I have made
      up my
      mind that the last days of my life shall at least be irreproachable externally” (VI). Perhaps Chekhov meant to
      hold his
      readers' attention by setting up and quickly overturning these expectations of “boredom.” This is what happens at
      the
      story’s finale when Gnekker’s machinations and Katya’s problems quickly interrupt Nikolai Stepanovich’s plans for
      an
      unremarkable, irreproachable end.

      There is in Russia an emeritus Professor Nikolay Stepanovitch, a chevalier and privy councillor; he has so many
      Russian
      and foreign decorations that when he has occasion to put them on the students nickname him "The Ikonstand." His
      acquaintances are of the most aristocratic; for the last twenty-five or thirty years, at any rate, there has not
      been
      one single distinguished man of learning in Russia with whom he has not been intimately acquainted. There is no
      one for
      him to make friends with nowadays; but if we turn to the past, the long list of his famous friends winds up with
      such
      names as Pirogov, Kavelin, and the poet Nekrasov, all of whom bestowed upon him a warm and sincere affection. He
      is a
      member of all the Russian and of three foreign universities. And so on, and so on. All that and a great deal more
      that
      might be said makes up what is called my "name."

      That is my name as known to the public. In Russia it is known to every educated man, and abroad it is mentioned in
      i<br><br><br><br><br>
      lecture-room with the addition "honoured and distinguished." It is one of those fortunate names to abuse which or
      to
      take which in vain, in public or in print, is considered a sign of bad taste. And that is as it should be. You
      see, my
      name is closely associated with the conception of a highly distinguished man of great gifts and unquestionable
      usefulness. I have the industry and power of endurance of a camel, and that is important, and I have talent, which
      is
      even more important. Moreover, while I am on this subject, I am a well-educated, modest, and honest fellow. I have
      never
      poked my nose into literature or politics; I have never sought popularity in polemics with the ignorant; I have
      never
      made speeches either at public dinners or at the funerals of my friends ... In fact, there is no slur on my
      learned
      name, and there is no complaint one can make against it. It is fortunate.

      The bearer of that name, that is I, see myself as a man of sixty-two, with a bald head, with false teeth, and with
      ani<br><br><br><br><br>
      incurable tic douloureux. I am myself as dingy and unsightly as my name is brilliant and splendid. My head and my
      hands
      tremble with weakness; my neck, as Turgenev says of one of his heroines, is like the handle of a double bass; my
      chest
      is hollow; my shoulders narrow; when I talk or lecture, my mouth turns down at one corner; when I smile, my whole
      face
      is covered with aged-looking, deathly wrinkles. There is nothing impressive about my pitiful figure; only,
      perhaps, when
      I have an attack of tic douloureux my face wears a peculiar expression, the sight of which must have roused in
      every one
      the grim and impressive thought, "Evidently that man will soon die."

      < 2>
        I still, as in the past, lecture fairly well; I can still, as in the past, hold the attention of my listeners
        for a
        couple of hours. My fervour, the literary skill of my exposition, and my humour, almost efface the defects of my
        voice, though it is harsh, dry, and monotonous as a praying beggar's. I write poorly. That bit of my brain which
        presides over the faculty of authorship refuses to work. My memory has grown weak; there is a lack of sequence
        in my
        ideas, and when I put them on paper it always seems to me that I have lost the instinct for their organic
        connection;
        my construction is monotonous; my language is poor and timid. Often I write what I do not mean; I have forgotten
        the
        beginning when I am writing the end. Often I forget ordinary words, and I always have to waste a great deal of
        energy
        in avoiding superfluous phrases and unnecessary parentheses in my letters, both unmistakable proofs of a decline
        in
        mental activity. And it is noteworthy that the simpler the letter the more painful the effort to write it. At a
        scientific article I feel far more intelligent and at ease than at a letter of congratulation or a minute of
        proceedings. Another point: I find it easier to write German or English than to write Russian.
        i<br><br><br><br><br>
        As regards my present manner of life, I must give a foremost place to the insomnia from which I have suffered of
        late.
        If I were asked what constituted the chief and fundamental feature of my existence now, I should answer,
        Insomnia. As
        in the past, from habit I undress and go to bed exactly at midnight. I fall asleep quickly, but before two
        o'clock I
        wake up and feel as though I had not slept at all. Sometimes I get out of bed and light a lamp. For an hour or
        two I
        walk up and down the room looking at the familiar photographs and pictures. When I am weary of walking about, I
        sit
        down to my table. I sit motionless, thinking of nothing, conscious of no inclination; if a book is lying before
        me, I
        mechanically move it closer and read it without any interest -- in that way not long ago I mechanically read
        through
        in one night a whole novel, with the strange title "The Song the Lark was Singing"; or to occupy my attention I
        force
        myself to count to a thousand; or I imagine the face of one of my colleagues and begin trying to remember in
        what year
        and under what circumstances he entered the service. I like listening to sounds. Two rooms away from me my
        daughter
        Liza says something rapidly in her sleep, or my wife crosses the drawing-room with a candle and invariably drops
        the
        matchbox; or a warped cupboard creaks; or the burner of the lamp suddenly begins to hum -- and all these sounds,
        for
        some reason, excite me.

        i<br><br><br><br><br>
        To lie awake at night means to be at every moment conscious of being abnormal, and so I look forward with
        impatience
        to the morning and the day when I have a right to be awake. Many wearisome hours pass before the cock crows in
        the
        yard. He is my first bringer of good tidings. As soon as he crows I know that within an hour the porter will
        wake up
        below, and, coughing angrily, will go upstairs to fetch something. And then a pale light will begin gradually
        glimmering at the windows, voices will sound in the street ...

        The day begins for me with the entrance of my wife. She comes in to me in her petticoat, before she has done
        her
        hair, but after she has washed, smelling of flower-scented eau-de-Cologne, looking as though she had come in
        by
        chance. Every time she says exactly the same thing: "Excuse me, I have just come in for a minute ... Have you
        had a
        bad night again?"

        Then she puts out the lamp, sits down near the table, and begins talking. I am no prophet, but I know what she
        will
        talk about. Every morning it is exactly the same thing. Usually, after anxious inquiries concerning my health,
        she
        suddenly mentions our son who is an officer serving at Warsaw. After the twentieth of each month we send him
        fifty
        roubles, and that serves as the chief topic of our conversation.

        "Of course it is difficult for us," my wife would sigh, "but until he is completely on his own feet it is our
        duty
        to help him. The boy is among strangers, his pay is small ... However, if you like, next month we won't send
        him
        fifty, but forty. What do you think?"
        <br><br><br><br><br>
        Daily experience might have taught my wife that constantly talking of our expenses does not reduce them, but
        my wife
        refuses to learn by experience, and regularly every morning discusses our officer son, and tells me that
        bread,
        thank God, is cheaper, while sugar is a halfpenny dearer -- with a tone and an air as though she were
        communicating
        interesting news.


        I listen, mechanically assent, and probably because I have had a bad night, strange and inappropriate
        thoughts
        intrude themselves upon me. I gaze at my wife and wonder like a child. I ask myself in perplexity, is it
        possible
        that this old, very stout, ungainly woman, with her dull expression of petty anxiety and alarm about daily
        bread,
        with eyes dimmed by continual brooding over debts and money difficulties, who can talk of nothing but
        expenses and
        who smiles at nothing but things getting cheaper -- is it possible that this woman is no other than the
        slender
        Varya whom I fell in love with so passionately for her fine, clear intelligence, for her pure soul, her
        beauty,
        and, as Othello his Desdemona, for her "sympathy" for my studies? Could that woman be no other than the
        Varya who
        had once borne me a son?i<br><br><br><br><br>

        I look with strained attention into the face of this flabby, spiritless, clumsy old woman, seeking in her my
        Varya, but of her past self nothing is left but her anxiety over my health and her manner of calling my
        salary
        "our salary," and my cap "our cap." It is painful for me to look at her, and, to give her what little
        comfort I
        can, I let her say what she likes, and say nothing even when she passes unjust criticisms on other people or
        pitches into me for not having a private practice or not publishing text-books.

        Our conversation always ends in the same way. My wife suddenly remembers with dismay that I have not had my
        tea.

        "What am I thinking about, sitting here?" she says, getting up. "The samovar has been on the table ever so
        long,
        and here I stay gossiping. My goodness! how forgetful I am growing!"

        She goes out quickly, and stops in the doorway to say:

        "We owe Yegor five months' wages. Did you know it? You mustn't let the servants' wages run on; how many
        times I
        have said it! It's much easier to pay ten roubles a month than fifty roubles every five months!"

        i<br><br><br><br><br>
        As she goes out, she stops to say:

        "The person I am sorriest for is our Liza. The girl studies at the Conservatoire, always mixes with people
        of
        good position, and goodness knows how she is dressed. Her fur coat is in such a state she is ashamed to
        show

        fingers, and say:

        "Creamy ice ... pistachio ... lemon ..."

        And now, from old habit, I kiss Liza's fingers and mutter: "Pistachio ... cream ... lemon ..." but the
        effect is
        utterly different. I am cold as ice and I am ashamed. When my daughter comes in to me and touches my
        forehead
        with her lips I start as though a bee had stung me on the head, give a forced smile, and turn my face
        away. Ever
        since I have been suffering from sleeplessness, a question sticks in my brain like a nail. My daughter
        often
        sees me, an old man and a distinguished man, blush painfully at being in debt to my footman; she sees how
        often
        anxiety over petty debts forces me to lay aside my work and to walk u p and down the room for hours
        together,
        thinking; but why is it she never comes to me in secret to whisper in my ear: "Father, here is my watch,
        here
        are my bracelets, my earrings, my dresses ... Pawn them all; you want money ..."? How is it that, seeing
        how her
        mother and I are placed in a false position and do our utmost to hide our poverty from people, she does
        not give
        up her expensive pleasure of music lessons? I would not accept her watch nor her bracelets, nor the
        sacrifice of
        her lessons -- God forbid! That isn't what I want.


        i<br><br><br><br><br>
        When I go to my own entrance the door is flung wide open, and I am met by my colleague, contemporary,
        and
        namesake, the porter Nikolay. As he lets me in he clears his throat and says:

        "A frost, your Excellency!"

        Or, if my great-coat is wet:

        "Rain, your Excellency!"

        Then he runs on ahead of me and opens all the doors on my way. In my study he carefully takes off my
        fur
        coat, and while doing so manages to tell me some bit of University news. Thanks to the close intimacy
        existing between all the University porters and beadles, he knows everything that goes on in the four
        faculties, in the office, in the rector's private room, in the library. What does he not know? When in
        an
        evil day a rector or dean, for instance, retires, I hear him in conversation with the young porters
        mention
        the candidates for the post, explain that such a one would not be confirmed by the minister, that
        another
        would himself refuse to accept it, then drop into fantastic details concerning mysterious papers
        received in
        the office, secret conversations alleged to have taken place between the minister and the trustee, and
        so
        on. With the exception of these details, he almost always turns out to be right. His estimates of the
        candidates, though original, are very correct, too. If one wants to know in what year some one read
        his
        thesis, entered the service, retired, or died, then summon to your assistance the vast memory of that
        soldier, and he will not only tell you the year, the month and the day, but will furnish you also with
        the
        details that accompanied this or that event. Only one who loves can remember like that.

        In our society the knowledge of the learned world consists of anecdotes of the extraordinary
        absentmindedness of certain old professors, and two or three witticisms variously ascribed to
        Gruber, to
        me, and to Babukin. For the educated public that is not much. If it loved science, learned men, and
        students, as Nikolay does, its literature would long ago have contained whole epics, records of
        sayings
        and doings such as, unfortunately, it cannot boast of now.

        "What did he lecture on?"

        I believe if Patti had sung in his very ear, if a horde of Chinese had invaded Russia, if there
        had been
        an earthquake, he would not have stirred a limb, but screwing up his eye, would have gone on
        calmly
        looking through his microscope. What is he to Hecuba or Hecuba to him, in fact? I would give a
        good deal
        to see how this dry stick sleeps with his wife at night.

        Another characteristic is his fanatical faith in the infallibility of science, and, above all, of
        everything written by the Germans. He believes in himself, in his preparations; knows the object
        of
        life, and knows nothing of the doubts and disappointments that turn the hair o f talent grey. He
        has a
        slavish reverence for authorities and a complete lack of any desire for independent thought. To
        change
        his convictions is difficult, to argue with him impossible. How is one to argue with a man who is
        firmly
        persuaded that medicine is the finest of sciences, that doctors are the best of men, and that the
        traditions of the medical profession are superior to those of any other? Of the evil past of
        medicine
        i<br><br><br><br><br>
        only one tradition has been preserved -- the white tie still worn by doctors; for a learned -- in
        fact,
        for any educated man the only traditions that can exist are those of the University as a whole,
        with no
        distinction between medicine, law, etc. But it would be hard for Pyotr Ignatyevitch to accept
        these
        facts, and he is ready to argue with you till the day of judgment.

        I have a clear picture in my mind of his future. In the course of his life he will prepare many
        hundreds
        of chemicals of exceptional purity; he will write a number of dry and very accurate memoranda,
        will make
        some dozen conscientious translations, but he won't do anything striking. To do that one must have
        imagination, inventiveness, the gift of insight, and Pyotr Ignatyevitch has nothing of the kind.
        In
        short, he is not a master in science, but a journeyman.

        < 10>
          Pyotr Ignatyevitch, Nikolay, and I, talk in subdued tones. We are not quite ourselves. There is
          always
          a peculiar feeling when one hears through the doors a murmur as of the sea from the
          lecture-theatre.
          i<br><br><br><br><br>
          In the course of thirty years I have not grown accustomed to this feeling, and I experience it
          every
          morning. I nervously button up my coat, ask Nikolay unnecessary questions, lose my temper ... It
          is
          just as though I were frightened; it is not timidity, though, but something different which I
          can
          neither describe nor find a name for.

          Quite unnecessarily, I look at my watch and say: "Well, it's time to go in."

          And we march into the room in the following order: foremost goes Nikolay, with the chemicals and
          apparatus or with a chart; after him I come; and then the carthorse follows humbly, with hanging
          head;
          or, when necessary, a dead body is carried in first on a stretcher, followed by Nikolay, and so
          on. On
          my entrance the students all stand up, then they sit down, and the sound as of the sea is
          suddenly
          hushed. Stillness reigns.

          I know what I am going to lecture about, but I don't know how I am going to lecture, where I am
          going
          to begin or with what I am going to end. I haven't a single sentence ready in my head. But I
          have only
          to look round the lecture-hall (it is built in the form of an amphitheatre) and utter the
          stereotyped
          phrase, "Last lecture we stopped at ..." when sentences spring up from my soul in a long string,
          and I
          am carried away by my own eloquence. I speak with irresistible rapidity and passion, and it
          seems as
          i<br><br><br><br><br>
          though there were no force which could check the flow of my words. To lecture well -- that is,
          with
          profit to the listeners and without boring them -- one must have, besides talent, experience and
          a
          special knack; one must possess a clear conception of one's own powers, of the audience to which
          one
          is lecturing, and of the subject of one's lecture. Moreover, one must be a man who knows what he
          is
          doing; one must keep a sharp lookout, and not for one second lose sight of what lies before one.

          < 11>
            A good conductor, interpreting the thought of the composer, does twenty things at once: reads
            the
            score, waves his baton, watches the singer, makes a motion sideways, first to the drum then to
            the
            i<br><br><br><br><br>
            wind-instruments, and so on. I do just the same when I lecture. Before me a hundred and fifty
            faces,
            all unlike one another; three hundred eyes all looking straight into my face. My object is to
            dominate this many-headed monster. If every moment as I lecture I have a clear vision of the
            degree
            of its attention and its power of comprehension, it is in my power. The other foe I have to
            overcome
            is in myself. It is the infinite variety of forms, phenomena, laws, and the multitude of ideas
            of my
            own and other people's conditioned by them. Every moment I must have the skill to snatch out
            of that
            vast mass of material
