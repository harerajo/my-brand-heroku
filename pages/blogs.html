      And the University of Reading said it was closing its three campuses "due to the risk of Storm Eunice to our
      community".
      SCOTLAND
      Scotland is expected to be lashed by Eunice on Friday with a yellow weather warning in place for snow until 6pm.
      Forecasters have anticipated blizzards to hit large parts of the country - with up to 20cm of snowfall expected in
      some

      parts.
      Dozens of schools have already taken measures to shut their doors ahead of the severe weather.
      In Aberdeenshire more than 30 schools were closed due to the forecast heavy snow.
      And it's expected more schools will follow suit.The aim of these writing prompts is to encourage freewriting. This
      is writing without stopping and without censoring.<br><br><br><br>
      Writing in this way can help to break through blocks like self-criticism and fear of failure, to find your own,
      unique
      voice.

      Choose a prompt and decide how long to write - ten minutes is a good length of time to begin with. Try to do one
      freewriting exercise a day.Every day at the station, you see someone you're attracted to, How would you go about
      getting yourself noticed?Formatted as a private autobiographical account, Anton Chekhov’s “A Boring Story” is the
      story of an elderly and
      illustrious medical professor named Nikolai Stepanovich. As Nikolai Stepanovich declares early in his account “my
      name<br><br><br><br>
      is closely associated with the conception of a highly distinguished man of great gifts and unquestionable
      usefulness”

      (I). But as “A Boring Story” progresses, these positive first impressions are undermined, and Nikolai Stepanovich
      describes in great detail his financial worries, his obsession with death, and his bouts of sleeplessness. He even
      views
      his physical appearance in an unflattering light: “I am myself as dingy and unsightly as my name is brilliant and
      splendid” (I).


      Many of Nikolai Stepanovich’s acquaintances, colleagues, and family members are sources of great irritation. He is
      tired
      of the mediocrity and absurd formality of his fellow medical specialists. And his students are a burden. As
      Nikolai<br><br><br><br><br>
      Stepanovich describes one young doctor who visits him in search of guidance, ‘the doctor gets a subject from me
      for his
      theme not worth a halfpenny, writes under my supervision a dissertation of no use to anyone, with dignity defends
      it in
      a dreary discussion, and receives a degree of no use to him” (II). Added to this are Nikolai Stepanovich’s wife,
      an
      “old, very stout, ungainly woman, with her dull expression of petty anxiety,” (I) and Nikolai Stepanovich’s
      daughter,
      who is being courted by a foppish, suspicious fellow named Gnekker.

      How to Prevent Students from Becoming Bored
      Yet there are a few consolations for the aging professor. Two of his regular companions are a young woman named
      Katya<br><br><br><br>
      and “a tall, well-built man of fifty” named Mikhail Fyodorovich (III). Although Katya and Mikhail are full of
      disdain
      for the society, and even for the world of science and learning, Nikolai Stepanovich seems attracted to the
      uncompromising sophistication and intelligence that they represent. But as Nikolai Stepanovich well knows, Katya
      was
      once extremely troubled. She tried a theatrical career and had a child out of wedlock, and Nikolai Stepanovich
      served as
      her correspondent and counselor during these misadventures.
